# Session 1

* Important to explain *why* we're doing a project before we dive into the details. Can read it out loud if necessary.
* Show an actual **camera** to highlight similarities with the human eye and explain how it works.
* Setting people up on GitHub and using SourceTree was messy.. let's try **animated gifs** to improve the process.

# Session 2

* **Peer learning**, typical (mis)behaviours:
	
	* reading out slides
	* cramming slides with too much text
	
* Peer learning, good stuff (picked up from students mini-lessons and shared with the class):

	* Make **examples**, visual and relatable
	* Use personal experiences and **stories** to communicate ideas
	* **Summarise** your mini-lesson (or part of it)
	* Ask **questions** to your audience: multiple-choice (don't require much thinking, create confrontation) or creative ones (eg: how could you sum XYZ up in a tweet?) rather than test-type ones (eg: what is the definition of XYZ?) 	  

# Session 3

* **Peer learning**, repeated (mis)behaviours:
	
	* reading out slides
	* cramming slides with too much text and/or small/busy images
	* not rehearsing mini-lesson
	* not having a **plan**: this is something to have a **workshop** on
	
* Seems like people are starting to take peer learning less seriously. Need to reinforce the benefits of peer-learning (*Why are we doing this?*), and make mini-lessons more interactive. Let's challenge students to deliver lessons **without slideshows**.
* Pick a mix of practice and theory topics, and make them all interactive and **activity-focused**, eg: teach your peers how to pick a colour scheme, get them to practically do XYZ (see [MozFest facilitation guide](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Festival2012/Submit#What_makes_a_good_Mozilla_Festival_session.3F) below)
 
> A good session has:

> *   **A clear purpose and desired outcome**
*   **A clear call for who can/should participate**
*   **A description of how it will transpire**

> A good session is:

> *   **Participatory:** Engaging and activating participants from the beginning and getting them making and doing, rather than listening and watching
*   **Purposeful:** Working on meaningful activities toward meaningful outputs
*   **Productive:** Well-scoped so that concrete outcomes are achieved in the allotted time, and participants feel time was well spent

> We believe that **peer-to-peer sessions are the most powerful way to facilitate interaction, build networks, and collaborate.** For that reason, the Mozilla Festival de-emphasizes lectures and presentations, and instead encourages dialog and hacking in small groups.

> As a facilitator, you will **frame the session goals, team up small groups, and ensure participants work productively & purposefully together.**
