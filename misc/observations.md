# Session 1

* Important to explain *why* we're doing a project before we dive into the details. Can read it out loud if necessary.
* Show an actual **camera** to highlight similarities with the human eye and explain how it works.
* Setting people up on GitHub and using SourceTree was messy.. let's try **animated gifs** to improve the process.

# Session 2

* **Peer learning**, typical (mis)behaviours:
	
	* reading out slides
	* cramming slides with too much text
	
* Peer learning, good stuff (picked up from students mini-lessons and shared with the class):

	* Make **examples**, visual and relatable
	* Use personal experiences and **stories** to communicate ideas
	* **Summarise** your mini-lesson (or part of it)
	* Ask **questions** to your audience: multiple-choice (don't require much thinking, create confrontation) or creative ones (eg: how could you sum XYZ up in a tweet?) rather than test-type ones (eg: what is the definition of XYZ?)
