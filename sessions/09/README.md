# Peer learning

### Why peer learning?

Learning from *each other, together*. It's a form of **cooperative** learning. 

In peer learning, everybody plays both the **teacher** and the **learner**.

By teaching to your peers, you reinforce your own learning. [It works](http://visible-learning.org/hattie-ranking-influences-effect-sizes-learning-achievement/hattie-ranking-teaching-effects)!

Also, you get to practice and build confidence in your **communication skills**.

### This is not a formal presentation

You're not being tested. 

You're not here to please me. 

You're here to teach to your peers and learn from them. 

You're here to practice what you'll do in your next job.

#### We're here to become *co-learners*.

### 8 teams

### 15 minutes per team

* One or more **remixable demos** of your trick on [Thimble](https://thimble.mozilla.org/)
* A quick **explanation** of your trick, preferably as an HTML5 presentation (you can use [slides.com](https://slides.com) for that)
* BONUS: **live examples** of your trick in action in other websites
* A **quiz** for your audience (you can use [Kahoot](https://getkahoot.com/) for that)

#### Tricks

1. How to use `color` and `background-color` to enhance the behaviour of elements in different states: `hover`, `focus`, `active` and `visited`. Include transparency, aka `rgba`.  
* How to style elements to look and feel like *clickable things* (usually referred to as *buttons*), including but not limited to CSS properties like `border` and `border-radius`.
* How to use `position: fixed;` to make elements stick to the page (not scroll away). 
* How to use `relative` and `absolute` `position`ing to control elements precisely (to the pixel). 
* How to centre elements horizontally, including but not limited to CSS properties like `display` and `margin: auto`.
* How to use CSS `transition`s.
* How to use animation libraries like [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css).  
* How to use vector icons from [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome).
