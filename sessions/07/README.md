# The good, the bad and the ugly

Let's collect shitty design examples on [this Pinterest board](https://www.pinterest.com/metodb/unbelievable-visual-design).

When adding a pin, add a short explanation of *why this design sucks* and specify which visual design principles (one or more, in any order) your example doesn't follow:

- [ ] There is no *harmony* in this design, because...
- [ ] The *spacing* of elements makes me cringe, because...  
- [ ] The *hierarchy* is off, because...  
- [ ] This design is *unbalanced*, because...
- [ ] The *contrast* is bad, because...
- [ ] *Scale* is used in a weird way, because...
- [ ] The *visually dominant* element is not the right one, because...
- [ ] Elements that should be *similar* are not, because...

# Workshop

Look around you at all the things that are organised in grids... 

### What is a grid system?

It's a structure comprising a series of **horizontal and vertical lines** which intersect and are then used to **organise** space, text, images, and any other element placed in a design.

### Pick 3 sites you like and draw their grids on paper!

### Why grids?

> Designers solve problems. Web designers are faced with finding solutions to visual and organisational problems and one approach to solving these problems is the grid. It’s not the only approach you might take, but it’s one with several important benefits.

From [Why grids?](http://www.vanseodesign.com/web-design/why-grids/)

#### **Order** 

Grids can bring order to a layout and make it easier for users to find and navigate through information.
	
#### **Consistency** 

Consistent layouts can help users absorb the information we’re trying to communicate (they learn where to find it, consistently) and build a sense of familiarity
	
#### **Proportion** 

Grids offer a guide to the placement of information and help generate visual hierarchy. They promote rhythm and consistency in a design and help you develop relationships between elements based on rational proportions.

#### **Efficiency** 

Grids allow designers to quickly add elements to a layout because many layout decisions are addressed while building the grid structure.
