### The Union Hack 

This **team project** is about about **symbols** and **brands**. By designing flags, you will devise symbols to represent identities and convert ideas into shapes. 

All the project material is [here](../../projects/union-hack).

### 8 teams

### ~15 minutes per team

1. What **existing flags** have you mashed up? Let's see.
* What **(real or imaginary) places** could you design flag(s) for? Let's see your sketches. 
* How are you going to present your ideas, creative process and experiments next week (**formative presentations**)?
* What's your team **GitHub repository**? You may want to [create an *organisation*](https://github.com/organizations/new) (a GitHub group) for that..
