# Team project

### The Union Hack 

This **team project** is about about **symbols** and **brands**. By designing flags, you will devise symbols to represent identities and convert ideas into shapes. 

All the project material is [here](../../projects/union-hack).

### 8 teams

### ~15 minutes per team

1. What **existing flags** have you mashed up? Let's see.
* What **(real or imaginary) places** could you design flag(s) for? Let's see your sketches. 
* How are you going to present your ideas, creative process and experiments next week (**formative presentations**)?
* What's your team **GitHub repository**? You may want to [create an *organisation*](https://github.com/organizations/new) (a GitHub group) for that.. 


# Homework

### Peer learning

1. **Publish** your mini-lesson and any other relevant material. We recommend GitHub (we :green_heart: :octocat:) but you can publish elsewhere as long as it's accessible by anyone.

2. Add the link to your mini-lesson (and any other relevant material) to the Google document you can find on Slack.

### Projects 

Work on *The Union Hack* **with your team**:

* Continue mashing up existing flags and experimenting with your new flag design.
* Document your research on your team GitHub repo.

Prepare to present your **ideas**, **experiments** and **creative process** to your colleagues and a special guest next week (28th of October, **formative presentations**).

You'll be presenting your work on:

1. EyeBombing
2. OneTweet
3. The Union Hack

Just to clarify: the **final deadline** for all projects is the **2nd of December**, so you can continue working on it throughout November. However, we will be starting another project after the formative, so the more you do before the formative, the better.

### Blog 

**Individually**, reflect on your peer learning mini-lesson today, and blog about it.

You can use the questions below as a guide for your blog post.

#### Mini-lesson **content**   
	
1. How did you **plan** your mini-lesson?
* What were the **key points** you wanted to get across?
* How did you decide to communicate them?
* What **assumptions** have you made about what we already know?
* How **interactive** was your mini-lesson? How was the audience meant to *participate*? 
* What **questions** have you planned to ask your audience? How *open* were those questions? What type of questions (*Right-there*, *Between-the-lines* or *Opinion-needed* questions)?
	
#### **Delivery**
	
1. What role did **visuals** (eg: slides, if you had any) play in your mini-lesson?
* What role did each **team member** play in delivering the mini-lesson? 
* How did you **practice** your mini-lesson?
* How did your mini-lesson start? How did you *hook* your audience?
* What was your **body language** like? Consider facial expressions, movements of the arms, eye contact with the audience, and posture.
* What was your **voice** like? Consider speed of delivery, pausing, volume and pitch.

#### What can you **improve**?
