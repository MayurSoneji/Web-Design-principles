### Peer-learning research

Choose a *visual perception principle* to research and teach next week:

1. Closure
2. Symmetry
3. figure/ground relationship
4. Connectedness 
5. Proximity
6. Continuation
7. Similarity
8. Past experience

<!-- 8 teams (~3 people each) -->

In your planning / presentation you might include:

* Summary of main ideas
* Links, images, or video of projects / products / things referenced in your research
* Other relevant things you've read, heard or seen
* Personal experiences

Each team should also prepare **1-2 questions for the class**. After hearing the presentations, we will have a short group discussion around these questions.


### Project 

Work on *EyeBombing* **with your team**.

### Blog 

**Individually**, write about *EyeBombing*. Reflect on the concept and document **your** thought process. You can post pictures of scribbled notes, or jot down notes digitally. It doesn't need to be fleshed out and well written. The main goal here is to record your flow of ideas, not to make it beautiful!
