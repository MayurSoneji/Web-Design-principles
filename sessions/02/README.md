# Peer learning

### What is peer learning?

It's a form of **cooperative** learning, that is: learning from *each other, together*.

In peer learning, everybody plays both the **teacher** and the **learner**.

<!-- > Docendo discimus [By teaching, we learn] -->

<!-- teaching forces you to dig deep and truly learn -->

By teaching to your peers, you reinforce your own learning. [It works](http://visible-learning.org/hattie-ranking-influences-effect-sizes-learning-achievement/hattie-ranking-teaching-effects)!

Also, you get to practice and build confidence in your **communication skills**.

At the end of your mini-lectures we'll give each other **feedback**. *Honest* feedback can hurt but it's through that (and practice) that we improve.

<!--
**Intellectual scaffolding** should be provided by the teacher. Simply placing students in groups and telling them to *work together* is not going to automatically yield results. The teacher must consciously *orchestrate* the learning exercise and choose the *appropriate vehicle* for it. For instance:

* picking subjects for teams, raising questions/issues that prompt students towards more sophisticated levels of thinking
*  structuring the tasks that learners are going to perform, both independently and in class
* watching for and correcting mistakes 
* providing positive feedback and encouragement

**Affinity Groups**: groups of 4–5 students are each assigned particular tasks to work on outside of formal contact time. At the next formal meeting with the teacher, the sub-group, or a group representative, presents the sub-group’s findings to the whole tutorial group.

**Positive interdependence** emphasises the importance and uniqueness of each group member’s efforts while important cognitive activities and interpersonal dynamics are quietly at work. As students communicate with one another, they inevitably assume leadership roles, acquire conflict-managing skills, discuss and clarify concepts, and unravel the complexities of human relationships within a given context; this process enhances their learning outcomes.

Beware of *freeloaders*.

### Let the peer learning begin

#### 8 teams

~3 people per team 

#### 15 minutes per team

* ~10 for mini-lecture 
* ~5 for questions and debate

#### Mini-lectures topics

1. Closure
* Symmetry
* Figure/ground relationship
* Connectedness 
* Proximity
* Continuation
* Similarity
* Past experience 

### Let's give each other *honest* **feedback**

#### Presentation **content**   
	
1. How did you **plan** your presentation?
* What were the **key points** you wanted to get across?
* How did you decide to communicate them?
* What **assumptions** have you made about what we already know?
* How **interactive** was your presentation? How was the audience meant to *participate*? 
* What **questions** have you planned to ask your audience? How *open* were those questions? What type of questions (*Right-there*, *Between-the-lines* or *Opinion-needed* questions)?
	
#### **Delivery**
	
1. What role did **visuals** (eg: slides) play in your presentation?
* What role did each **team member** play in delivering the presentation? 
* How did you **practice** your presentation?
* How did your presentation start? How did you *hook* your audience?
* What was your **body language** like? Consider facial expressions, movements of the arms, eye contact with the audience, and posture.
* What was your **voice** like? Consider speed of delivery, pausing, volume and pitch
	
#### What can be **improved**?

# Team project

### EyeBombing tutorials

This **team project** is about *looking* and *creating images*. Looking at everyday objects and our surroundings with different eyes and using **photography** to frame them, so that others can see what we want them to see.

All the project material is [here](../../projects/eye-bombing).

### 8 teams

### 10 minutes per team


1. Let's see your **images** and **edits**.  
	* What have you made?
	* How can you improve them? Quality vs quantity, **visual perception** principles you could apply...
* What has your **creative process** been so far?
	
	<!-- -->
* What's your team **GitHub repository**? 

	You may want to [create an *organisation*](https://github.com/organizations/new) (a GitHub group) for that. 





# Homework

### Peer learning

1. **Publish** your presentation and any other relevant material. We recommend GitHub (we :green_heart: :octocat:) but you can publish elsewhere as long as it's accessible by anyone.

2. Add the link to your presentation (and any other relevant material) to the `Teams` Google document I emailed you.

- [ ] Choose a Photoshop trick to practice and teach next week

### Project 

Work on *OneTweet*:

<!--* Pick one idea to finalise.
* Continue coding: push your experiments to the team GitHub repo.
* Document your research on your team GitHub repo wiki-->

### Blog 

Pair up with another team and **give each other feedback** on your peer learning mini-lectures. 

Use the questions above to give / get feedback on your [presentations' content](#presentation-content) and [delivery](#delivery).

Then write down a *summary* of the feedback you received and a *list of action points* in response to the question:
