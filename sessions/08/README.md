# What is **code**?

Can you fill in the blanks?

#### [...] code

Think of words/phrases that end with `code`.

<!-- *Morse code*, *post code*, *dress code*... -->

Code existed **before computers**.

Code is about

*   transmitting information
*   giving instructions
*   **communication**

If I want to talk to my **grandma**, I need to use Italian. To communicate with you, I use English. 

To **talk to a computer**, we use...

#### Code is **instructions** to a computer: extremely powerful, fundamentally thick.

### How do you learn to code?

Remember how you learned your first language as a child?

You learned your first language by copying people around you, observing their reactions to your actions.

> If I say `mum` then that one person will respond. She also responds when I cry. She doesn't respond to other names, it seems.

Learning a coding language is like **learning a new language**.

#### **Translating** your ideas into a language your computer understands

#### **Observing** how the computer responds to our commands, and adapting them (aka *feedback loop*)

**Today** you're going to learn **2 new languages**.
