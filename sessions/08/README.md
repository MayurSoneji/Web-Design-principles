# What is **code**?

Can you fill in the blanks?

#### [...] code

Think of words/phrases that end with `code`.

<!-- *Morse code*, *post code*, *dress code*... -->

Code existed **before computers**.

Code is about

*   transmitting information
*   giving instructions
*   **communication**

If I want to talk to my **grandma**, I need to use Italian. To communicate with you, I use English. 

To **talk to a computer**, we use...

#### Code is **instructions** to a computer: extremely powerful, fundamentally thick.

### How do you learn to code?

Remember how you learned your first language as a child?

You learned your first language by copying people around you, observing their reactions to your actions.

> If I say `mum` then that one person will respond. She also responds when I cry. She doesn't respond to other names, it seems.

Learning a coding language is like **learning a new language**.

#### **Translating** your ideas into a language your computer understands

#### **Observing** how the computer responds to your inputs and adapting them until it works

**Today** you're going to learn **2 new languages**.


# Meet HTML

### `HTML` = How To Make Lunch 

#### true / false ?

> A **markup language** is a modern system for **annotating** a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. 

> The idea and terminology evolved from the *marking up* of paper manuscripts: the revision instructions by editors, traditionally written with a blue pencil on authors' manuscripts.

> From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language)

All your **digital texts** are marked up, whether you see the **markup** or not. That is, they contain both content and meta-content.

**HTML** is one of many markup languages, the one used to mark up documents (aka *hypertexts*) on the WWW. 

### `<p>`Hello`</p>`

##### `<p id="message">`Hello`</p>`

# Your turn

We're going to use [Thimble](https://thimble.mozilla.org/), an amazing online open-source code editor, to write our favourite recipe in HTML.

1. You should have written your **recipe** as a **MD** document and published it to **GitHub**. Go find it and then click on the `Raw` button. 

	![](assets/raw.png)
* **Copy** your recipe's MD.
* Go to [dillinger.io](http://dillinger.io/) and paste your recipe's MD into it.
* Export it as HTML

	![](assets/dillinger.jpg) 
* Go to [thimble.mozilla.org](https://thimble.mozilla.org/) and sign up.
* Start a project from scratch.
* Paste your recipe's HTML between `<body>` and `</body>` (you can get rid of the default `h1` and `p`). 
* Click on any element in HTML and then <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd> to bring up a definition of that element.

Let's **focus on the HTML** (we'll use CSS to style it later). 

#### Checklist

* Does you recipe contain all the **information** necessary for someone else to prepare the dish you chose?

* Is that information **well structured**? Are you using appropriate HTML tags to mark up that information?   
  
	For instance, what structure is appropriate for the ingredients *list*? And which is appropriate for the preparation steps *list*? Don't just use `p` everywhere..

* Is your recipe's information **accessible**? Remember, not everybody (both humans and *robots*) can see your recipe.

	For example: use images to visualise something that you've already explained through text, and add `alt="DESCRIBE YOUR IMAGE HERE"` to all your `img` elements. That way, they'll be more search-engine-friendly, and accessible to people who don't consume your page visually.

# Homework

### Peer-learning: **CSS tricks**!

On the Google document I emailed you (you can also find it on Slack), there's a new table called **CSS tricks** for you to learn and teach next week.

Your team **mini-lesson** should be **~15 minutes** and include:

* One or more **remixable demos** of your trick on [Thimble](https://thimble.mozilla.org/)
* A quick **explanation** of your trick, preferably as an HTML5 presentation (you can use [slides.com](https://slides.com) for that)
* A **quiz** for your audience (you can use [Kahoot](https://getkahoot.com/) for that)

##### Topics: 



### Blog

Continue working on [Code in your plate](../../projects/code-in-your-plate) and blog about it:

* Write about your **design process**. What inspires you, what do you want to achieve?
* Write about your **coding process**. How are you translating your design ideas into code? What and how are you learning?
