### Your [homework](#homework) and [blog](#blog)


# Formative assessment

<!--- [ ] Why do we do this?-->

#### Today

You will present both your team projects ([EyeBombing](#eyebombing) and [Union Hack](#the-union-hack)) and your individual project ([OneTweet](#onetweet)). 

This means that you will present **three times** throughout the day.

We will give you **verbal feedback** after each round of presentations. That is, after all *EyeBombing* presentations, after all *OneTweet* presentations and after all *Union Hack* presentations. 

#### After today

We will type up the feedback and share it with you (via Google docs / Slack).

You will get feedback both on your team projects and your individual work.

You will reflect on this feedback (*self-assessment*) and write your thoughts in a blog post. See [more details below]().

### EyeBombing

* 8 teams
* **10 minutes** / team

This **team project** is about *looking* and *creating images*. Looking at everyday objects and our surroundings with different eyes and using **photography** to frame them, so that others can see what we want them to see.

All the project material is [here](../../projects/eye-bombing).

<!--When presenting your work, you may highlight: 

* **Originality** of your subject, the less *in-your-face* (obvious / common) a subject the better.
* **Manipulation**, the less you interfered with a subject the better. For instance, drawing a face on a dusty surface is not the point of this project. Arranging objects to resemble a face is ok, but we prefer *ready-made* subjects, which you simply found and framed, rather than manipulated.
* **Framing**, the point(s) of view you chose for your subject to highlight its *faceyness*. Framing an image has as much to do with what you include as what you exclude. 
* **Interpretation**, how your subject is cropped (or otherwise edited) to highlight its *faceyness*.-->

###  OneTweet

* 21 people
* **5 minutes** / person

This project is about about **typography** and creating *meaning with text*.

All the project material is [here](../../projects/one-tweet).

###  The Union Hack 

* 7-8 teams
* **10 minutes** / team

This **team project** is about about **symbols** and **brands**. By designing flags, you will devise symbols to represent identities and convert ideas into shapes. 

All the project material is [here](../../projects/union-hack).


# Homework

### Blog 

**Individually**, reflect on the feedback you received during the formative assessment, as well as your experience in this unit so far, and write about it.

Your post should address these questions (in no particular order):

* **ME**:
	* How and what did I learn?
	* What worked and what didn't?
	* Did I reach my goals, why or why not?  
	* How did I feel during the process?  

* My **TEAM**:
	* How did the team perform?
	* What worked and what didn't?
	* What can we do better next time?
	* Did the team reach the goal?
	* Was there conflict, how do we fix it?
