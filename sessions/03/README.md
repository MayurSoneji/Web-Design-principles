-->

<!--### Let the peer learning begin-->

~3 people per team 

#### 15 minutes per team

* ~10 for mini-lesson 
* ~5 for questions and debate

#### Mini-lessons topics

1. How do people read?

* Fonts: serif, sans-serif etc, weights and styles 
* The personality of fonts: expressive typography
* Horizontal and vertical motion: alignments, kerning, tracking and leading

# Project

### OneTweet tutorials

This project is about about **typography** and creating *meaning with text*.

All the project material is [here](../../projects/one-tweet).

This is *not a team project* but we'll see people in groups of 2-3, possibly grouping people who are working on the same tweet.

### 4 groups

### 15 minutes per group 

That is, ~5 minutes per person.

1. Let's see your **posters**.
* Which tweet did you choose and why?
* What variations did you produce? 
* Which visual perception principles have you explored (either alone or in combos)?
* What fonts and colours did you pick?
* What ideas could you *steal* (ehm, `fork`) from your peers?


# Team project

### The Union Hack 

This **team project** is about about **symbols** and **brands**. By designing flags, you will devise symbols to represent identities and convert ideas into shapes. 

All the project material is [here](../../projects/union-hack).

Today:

1. Form teams.
* Set up a GitHub repository for your team project.

Between today and next week:

1. Mash up existing flags.
* Jot down ideas for places (real or imaginary) and the flag(s) you could design for them. 
* Record your creative process in your blogs.

Next week:

Formative Assessment

The Week After:

1. We'll review your work in class
	
	* What have you made?
	* How can you improve it?
* Continue mashing up existing flags and designing new flags.	

Formative presentation (28.10):

1. Present your work as a team, both process and results.
* Reflect on what you learned from it.* 
 

# Homework

### Typography

1. **Publish** your mini-lesson and any other relevant material from today. We recommend GitHub (we :green_heart: :octocat:) but you can publish elsewhere as long as it's accessible by anyone.

2. Add the link to your mini-lesson and any other relevant material to the Google document I emailed you (it's also on Slack).

### Peer learning research ( due for the week after next, 7th Nov)

#### Symbols and brands

On the Google document I emailed you (you can also find it on Slack), there's a new table with topics around **symbols and brands** for you to learn and teach in our next session after formative.

We'll do this again in *teams*, but not the same people you worked with this week.

Your team **mini-lesson** should be **~10 minutes** and you may include:

* **3 key ideas**
* **Examples** and demonstrations
* Personal **experiences**
* **3 open questions to ask the class**

##### Topics: 

1. **Visual symbols** and their cultural meanings, eg: scales → justice, lion → strength/king, apple → health/temptation/tech-company, red → stop/error, floppy disk → save [etc](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheFloppyDiskMeansSaveAnd14OtherOldPeopleIconsThatDontMakeSenseAnymore.aspx).  
  
	Find plenty of *good* and *bad* examples.
* **Visual techniques** (aka *rhetorical devices*) for non-literal communication:   
	
	* simile 
 	* metaphor
	* metonym and synecdoche
	* irony / sarcasm
	* lies 

	Find plenty of *good* and *bad* examples.
* Designing with **colours**: [how to create your own palette](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/02/color-theory-for-designer-part-3-creating-your-own-color-palettes), even an [edible one](http://idsgn.org/posts/an-edible-color-palette)!
* Websites/apps as extensions of a **brand**. Pick 5 websites/apps and analyse their **colours**:
	
	* What brand *identity* and *values* do they aim to communicate?
	* How do they do that *through colours*? Be specific, make plenty of examples.
	* What *emotional responses* are the brands trying to trigger? Is it effective?   
  
	During your mini-lesson, first ask the class what their thoughts are and then present your findings.
* Websites/apps as extensions of a **brand**. Pick 5 websites/apps and analyse their **typography**:
	
	* What brand *identity* and *values* do they aim to communicate?
	* How do they do that *through typography*? Be specific, make plenty of examples.
	* What *emotional responses* are the brands trying to trigger? Is it effective?   
  
	During your mini-lesson, first ask the class what their thoughts are and then present your findings. 
* Websites/apps as extensions of a **brand**. Pick 5 websites/apps and analyse their **images&video**:
	
	* What brand *identity* and *values* do they aim to communicate?
	* How do they do that *through images&video*? Be specific, make plenty of examples.
	* What *emotional responses* are the brands trying to trigger? Is it effective?   
  
	During your mini-lesson, first ask the class what their thoughts are and then present your findings. 
* **Visual hierarchy** experiment, using websites/apps that your audience is familiar with:

 	* List the key information points that users are likely seeking.
	* Assign values (1-5) according to their importance to the average user.
	* Now, look at the actual design again.
	* Assign values (1-5) according to the actual visual importance as you see it in the live design.
	* Does the expected importance match up with the actual designed importance? If not, what could be changed?   
  
	During your mini-lesson, first ask the class what their thoughts are and then present your findings.

### Project 

Work on *The Union Hack* with your **team**.

1. Set up a GitHub repository for your team project.
* Mash up existing flags.
* Jot down ideas for places (real or imaginary) and the flag(s) you could design for them.


### Blog 

**Individually**, write about *The Union Hack*. 

Reflect on the concept and document **your** creative process. 

You can post pictures of scribbled notes, or jot down notes digitally. It doesn't need to be fleshed out and well written. The main goal here is to record your flow of ideas, not to make it beautiful!
