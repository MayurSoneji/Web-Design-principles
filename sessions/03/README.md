#### Mini-lessons topics

1. How do people read?

* Fonts: serif, sans-serif etc, weights and styles 
* The personality of fonts: expressive typography
* Horizontal and vertical motion: alignments, kerning, tracking and leading 
* Proportion: typographic scales

* How to choose the right font


# Project

### OneTweet tutorials

This project is about about **typography** and creating *meaning with text*.

All the project material is [here](../../projects/one-tweet).

This is *not a team project* but we'll see people in groups of 2-3, possibly grouping people who are working on the same tweet.

### 8 groups

### 15 minutes per group 

That is, ~5 minutes per person.

1. Let's see your **posters**.
* Which tweet did you choose and why?
* What variations did you produce? 
* Which visual perception principles have you explored (either alone or in combos)?
* What fonts and colours did you pick?
* What ideas could you *steal* (ehm, `fork`) from your peers?


# Homework
