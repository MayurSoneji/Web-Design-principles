# Web Design principles

During this project you will learn the principles of visual communication by researching and designing *objects that communicate*. 

In particular, you will

* examine how people make sense of visual perceptions, which will help you make informed design decisions
* explore different ways of looking at and framing everyday objects through photography and image manipulation
* experiment with typography and graphic layout to turn data into information and evoke meaning
* use HTML to structure information and CSS to make it aesthetically cohesive and accessible
* get familiar with the malleable medium of the Web and Responsive Web Design methods
* work in teams, learning from your peers and teaching them what you learned
* document your work regularly and reflect on your creative process
